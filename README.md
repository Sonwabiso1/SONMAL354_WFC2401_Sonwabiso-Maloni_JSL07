# [JSL07] Submission: Proud of your Progress

Create a personalized certificate of achievement with the "Proud of Your Progress Certificate Generator". This web application requires users to input their name, a personalized message, and the course name to dynamically generate a certificate displayed in a modal.

## Project Features
- **Input Fields:** For user's name, personalized message, and course name.
- **Generate Certificate:** A button that when clicked, creates the certificate.
- **Modal Display:** The certificate is shown in a modal window.
- **Close Button:** For closing the modal.
- **Validation:** Checks that all fields are completed before certificate generation.

## Development Objectives
- **Dynamic Content:** Dynamically generate the certificate's content based on user input, ensuring it matches the reference solution.
- **Modal Implementation:** Show the certificate in a modal upon form submission; the modal should initially be hidden.
- **Interaction Handling:** Enable modal display with form submission and allow closing with a close button. Ensure form inputs are cleared post-submission.

## Learning Reflection
In developing this project, I learned several key concepts and techniques:
- **DOM Manipulation**: I gained a better understanding of how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to dynamically update the content of a web page.
- **Event Handling**: I learned how to handle form submissions and button clicks using event listeners to trigger specific actions.
- **CSS Styling**: I practiced styling HTML elements using CSS to enhance the visual appearance of the application and ensure proper layout.
- **Problem-Solving**: I encountered various challenges throughout the development process, such as properly formatting the certificate content and handling image display, which required creative problem-solving and research skills.

## Areas of Growth
While working on this project, I identified several areas where I can further improve:
- **Code Organization**: I could improve the organization of my JavaScript code by breaking it down into smaller, reusable functions and modules for better readability and maintainability.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing more robust error handling mechanisms, such as form validation, to provide better user feedback and prevent unexpected behavior.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhancing the application's responsiveness to ensure a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Testing**: Incorporating automated testing practices, such as unit tests and integration tests, to verify the functionality and performance of the application.
